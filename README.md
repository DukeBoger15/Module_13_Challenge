<H1>Module 13 Challenge - Venture Funding with Deep Learning</H1>
<li>This repository contains the code for my FinTech Bootcamp Module 13 Challenge.</li>
<H2>Background</H2>
<li>Working as a risk management associate at Alphabet Soup, a venture capital firm, Alphabet Soup's business team receives many funding applications from startups everyday. This team has asked us to help create a model that predicts whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.</li>
<li>The business team has given us a CSV file containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. The CSV file contains a variety of information abount each business, including whether or not it ultimately became successful. With our knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, we decide to use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier model that will predict whether an applicant will become a successful business.</li>
<H3>Application</H3>
<li>To predict the success or failure of Alphabet Soup applicants will be successful, we will create a binary classification model using a deep neural network. The code will consist of 3 deliverables. We will do the following:</li>
<li>1). Preprocess data for a neural network model</li>
<li>2). Use the model-fit-predict pattern to compile and evaluate a binary classification model.</li>
<li>3). Optimize the model.</li>
<H4>Libraires and Technologies Used</H4>
<li>1). pandas</li>
<li>2). tensorflow</li>
<li>3). scikit-learn, including sklearn model selection, sklearn preprocession, Standard Scaler, OneHotEncoder</li>
<li>4). keras</li>
<li>5). JupyterLab</li>
<H5>Usage</H5>
<li>To use this application, please clone the repository and open JupyterLab. In JupyterLab, use the run tab, and select run all cells.</li>
